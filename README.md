## CRT-YT-DOWN

This is a wrapper for the command line utility [youtube-dl](https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/)

Decided to build this as a learning project get hands on experience with Electron.

I'm sure you noticed but this is forked from [electron/electron-quick-start](https://github.com/electron/electron-quick-start).

To run this:

1. Clone, duh
2. `npm install`
3. `npm start`

Clone/Fork copy, do whatever you want with this. Just know that I don't take responsibility if you burn down your house or anything at all that happens due to use of this software.

// TODO: add missing steps to make this really work
